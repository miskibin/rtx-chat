# My Life Story - Memory Test

## About Me
I'm a software engineer living in San Francisco. I love working on AI projects and spending time outdoors. I prefer concise, technical communication and I dislike unnecessary jargon. I always appreciate when people are direct and honest with me. I work best in the mornings and I usually take breaks to go for a run or meditate to clear my head.

## People in My Life

### Sarah
Sarah is my best friend from college. We met in a computer science class and have been friends for about 7 years. She's a product manager at a tech startup. We have a positive relationship and stay in touch despite both being busy. Sarah is married to Tom and they have a dog named Max. Sarah lives in San Jose and we try to grab coffee at least once a month.

### Tom
Tom is Sarah's husband. I've known him for about 5 years through Sarah. He's a civil engineer and he's very knowledgeable about infrastructure projects. We have a friendly relationship and I appreciate his practical approach to problem-solving. Tom is quite introverted but very reliable.

### Alex
Alex is my colleague at work. We work on the same machine learning team. Our relationship is professional but friendly. Alex specializes in computer vision and has taught me a lot about neural networks. Recently, Alex got promoted to senior engineer, which was well-deserved. We sometimes debate technical approaches during code reviews, which I find valuable.

### Maria
Maria is my younger sister. She's 5 years younger than me and is currently studying biology at UC Berkeley. I care deeply about her and try to help her with career advice. She mentioned she's considering a gap year after graduation to travel. We have a close but sometimes complicated relationship - I can be overprotective.

### David
David is an old friend from high school. We reconnected recently after about 10 years. He moved back to the Bay Area and works in finance. David is quite different from me - he's more social and loves networking. I find his perspective interesting though sometimes his materialistic values clash with my own. We've been catching up over drinks occasionally.

## Key Events

### The AI Hackathon (September 2025)
I participated in a major AI hackathon with Alex and another colleague named Jordan. We built an image recognition system that won second place. It was an intense weekend but really energizing. Maria came to watch the final presentations and was proud of what we accomplished. Sarah and Tom also showed up to support us.

### Sarah's Birthday Party (July 2025)
Sarah turned 30 and had a big celebration. Alex, Tom, David, and I all attended. It was a fun evening and Tom's homemade pasta was incredible. Alex got quite drunk and was telling everyone about his crush, which was entertaining. We all stayed until late playing board games.

### Hiking Trip (August 2025)
I organized a hiking trip to Big Sur with Alex and David. The scenery was breathtaking. Alex was constantly distracted by trying to photograph everything with his phone. David kept complaining about the lack of cell service. Despite that, it was a good bonding experience and we have great memories.
